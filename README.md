⛳ Golf Club Distance Comparison

Author: Jackson Justice


🎯 Project Overview

This project explores whether golf club type affects how far a golf ball travels.
Three clubs — a 7-iron, 9-iron, and pitching wedge — were tested under consistent conditions with 15 total shots (5 swings per club).

The data were analyzed in R using summary statistics, boxplots, and a one-way ANOVA.


📊 Results
Club	Mean Distance (yards)
- 7-Iron	152
- 9-Iron	132
- Pitching Wedge	112

ANOVA: p-value < 0.001
→ There is a statistically significant difference between clubs.


🧠 Conclusion
Longer clubs produced greater average distances, which matches expectations based on loft and shaft length.
